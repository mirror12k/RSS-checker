# RSS checker
A simple RSS retriever and updator which presents a list of recently published articles on the given rss feeds. To retrieve any rss links, run `./RSSScraper.pm <blog url>`, then insert it into check.pl's list of rss urls. then run `./check.pl <number of days>` to view a list of all articles published up to some number of days back.

## why?
I made this for myself, might as well upload it if anyone might get some use out of it.
